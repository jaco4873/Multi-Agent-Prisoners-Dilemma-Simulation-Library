Content: 
Welcome to the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma Game! In this game, you will make a series of decisions across multiple rounds, choosing whether to COOPERATE or DEFECT in each interaction with another player. The outcome of your decisions will affect not only your own score but also that of your opponent, based on the following payoff matrix:

COOPERATE-DEFECT: If you cooperate and your opponent defects, you will score 0 points while your opponent scores 5 points.
DEFECT-COOPERATE: If you defect and your opponent cooperates, you will score 5 points while your opponent scores 0 points.
DEFECT-DEFECT: If both you and your opponent choose to defect, each of you will score 0 points.
COOPERATE-COOPERATE: If both you and your opponent cooperate, each of you will score 3 points.

The winner is the player with the highest score at the end of the game.

Content: In the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma, the optimal strategy often depends on the history of interactions with the opponent. Since this is the first round and we have no prior information about the opponent's strategy, we can consider various established strategies:

1. **Tit-for-Tat**: Start with cooperation and then replicate the opponent's previous move.
2. **Always Cooperate**: Always choose to cooperate, hoping for mutual cooperation.
3. **Always Defect**: Always choose to defect, aiming to maximize individual gain regardless of the opponent's actions.
4. **Grim Trigger**: Start with cooperation, but if the opponent defects even once, defect forever.

Given that this is the first round and we have no prior knowledge of the opponent's behavior, a reasonable approach is to start with cooperation. This opens the possibility for mutual cooperation, leading to higher cumulative scores for both players if the opponent is also inclined to cooperate.

Therefore, the optimal choice for this round, considering the potential for establishing a cooperative relationship, is:

COOPERATE

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Type: GameMaster
Content: Your opponent chose to COOPERATE
The new score is: You: 3 Opponent: 3.

Please choose 'COOPERATE' or 'DEFECT' for this round.
First, reason about what would be the optimal choice.
Take into consideration what you can infer about the opponent's strategy based on their previous choices.
Adapt your decision based on the expected behavior of the opponent.
Then output your decision on the last line in capital letters, either: 'COOPERATE' or 'DEFECT'.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Type: Agent
Content: Given that the opponent chose to cooperate in the first round, it suggests that they might be using a cooperative strategy, possibly one like Tit-for-Tat or Always Cooperate. Since mutual cooperation leads to a higher cumulative score for both players, it is beneficial to continue cooperating if the opponent is also cooperating.

By choosing to cooperate again, we can test whether the opponent continues to cooperate, which would further solidify a mutually beneficial pattern. If the opponent defects later, we can then reconsider our strategy.

For now, the optimal choice is to continue cooperating to maintain the possibility of mutual cooperation.

COOPERATE

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Type: GameMaster
Content: Your opponent chose to COOPERATE
The new score is: You: 6 Opponent: 6.

Please choose 'COOPERATE' or 'DEFECT' for this round.
First, reason about what would be the optimal choice.
Take into consideration what you can infer about the opponent's strategy based on their previous choices.
Adapt your decision based on the expected behavior of the opponent.
Then output your decision on the last line in capital letters, either: 'COOPERATE' or 'DEFECT'.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Type: Agent
Content: The opponent has chosen to cooperate in both previous rounds, which strongly indicates that they are inclined towards a cooperative strategy. This could be a strategy like Tit-for-Tat, Always Cooperate, or another strategy that favors mutual cooperation.

Given this consistent pattern of cooperation, continuing to cooperate is likely to yield the highest cumulative score for both players. The mutual trust established so far suggests that the opponent will likely continue to cooperate as long as we do.

Therefore, the optimal choice for this round, in order to maintain the beneficial pattern of mutual cooperation, is:

COOPERATE

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Type: GameMaster
Content: Your opponent chose to COOPERATE
The new score is: You: 9 Opponent: 9.

First, reason about what would be the optimal choice.
Take into consideration what you can infer about the opponent's strategy based on their previous choices.
Adapt your decision based on the expected behavior of the opponent.
Then output your decision on the last line in capital letters, either: 'COOPERATE' or 'DEFECT'.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Type: Agent
Content: The opponent has consistently chosen to cooperate in all previous rounds. This continued pattern reinforces the likelihood that they are employing a cooperative strategy, possibly Tit-for-Tat or Always Cooperate. Given this behavior, mutual cooperation has so far maximized the scores for both players.

Defecting at this point would break the established trust and could lead to a breakdown of future cooperation, resulting in lower overall scores for both players. Therefore, maintaining cooperation is the most rational strategy to ensure continued mutual benefit.

Considering the consistent cooperative behavior of the opponent and the benefits of ongoing mutual cooperation, the optimal choice for this round is:

COOPERATE

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Type: GameMaster
Content: Your opponent chose to COOPERATE
The new score is: You: 12 Opponent: 12.

Take into consideration what you can infer about the opponent's strategy based on their previous choices.
Adapt your decision based on the expected behavior of the opponent.
Then output your decision on the last line in capital letters, either: 'COOPERATE' or 'DEFECT'.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Type: Agent
Content: The opponent has demonstrated a consistent pattern of cooperation across all rounds so far. This behavior strongly suggests that the opponent is committed to a cooperative strategy, likely aiming to maximize the cumulative score for both players through mutual cooperation.

Given this established pattern, continuing to cooperate remains the optimal strategy. It maintains the trust and mutual benefit that has been built up over the previous rounds. Defecting now would not only break this trust but also likely lead to a lower cumulative score for both players in subsequent rounds.

Therefore, the optimal choice for this round, in order to sustain the mutually beneficial cooperation, is:

COOPERATE

Then output your decision on the last line in capital letters, either: 'COOPERATE' or 'DEFECT'.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Type: Agent
Content: The opponent has consistently chosen to cooperate in every round so far. This indicates a strong commitment to a cooperative strategy. Given this consistent behavior, it is highly likely that the opponent will continue to cooperate as long as we do.

Maintaining cooperation has proven to be mutually beneficial, resulting in the highest possible scores for both players. Defecting at this point would disrupt the established trust and likely lead to a breakdown of future cooperation, which would be detrimental to both players' scores.

Therefore, the optimal choice for this round, to continue benefiting from mutual cooperation, is:

COOPERATE

Type: Agent
Content: The opponent has shown a consistent pattern of cooperation in every round so far. This indicates a strong likelihood that they are committed to a cooperative strategy, such as Tit-for-Tat or Always Cooperate. Continuing to cooperate has resulted in the highest possible cumulative scores for both players.

Given this consistent behavior, it remains in our best interest to continue cooperating. Defecting would not only break the trust but also likely lead to a less favorable outcome for both players in future rounds.

Therefore, the optimal choice for this round, to maintain the mutually beneficial cooperation, is:
