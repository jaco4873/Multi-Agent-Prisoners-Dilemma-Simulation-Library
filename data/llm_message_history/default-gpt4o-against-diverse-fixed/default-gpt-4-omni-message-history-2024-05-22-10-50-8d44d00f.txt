Welcome to the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma Game! In this game, you will make a series of decisions across multiple rounds, choosing whether to COOPERATE or DEFECT in each interaction with another player. The outcome of your decisions will affect not only your own score but also that of your opponent, based on the following payoff matrix:

COOPERATE-DEFECT: If you cooperate and your opponent defects, you will score 0 points while your opponent scores 5 points.
DEFECT-COOPERATE: If you defect and your opponent cooperates, you will score 5 points while your opponent scores 0 points.
DEFECT-DEFECT: If both you and your opponent choose to defect, each of you will score 0 points.
COOPERATE-COOPERATE: If both you and your opponent cooperate, each of you will score 3 points.

The winner is the player with the highest score at the end of the game.

Content: In the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma, the optimal choice often depends on the strategy of the opponent. Since this is the first round, there is no prior history to analyze, making it challenging to predict the opponent's strategy. However, several well-known strategies can be considered:

1. **Tit-for-Tat**: This strategy starts with cooperation and then mimics the opponent's previous move.
2. **Always Defect**: This strategy always defects, aiming to maximize individual gain regardless of the opponent's actions.
3. **Always Cooperate**: This strategy always cooperates, hoping for mutual benefit.
4. **Random**: This strategy randomly chooses between cooperation and defection.

Given that cooperation can lead to mutually beneficial outcomes (3 points each), and considering that many successful strategies in the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma begin with cooperation to test the waters, it would be reasonable to start with cooperation. This can help establish a foundation of trust and potentially lead to higher cumulative scores if the opponent is also inclined to cooperate.

Therefore, for the first round, the optimal choice is to:

COOPERATE

Adapt your decision based on the expected behavior of the opponent.
Then output your decision on the last line in capital letters, either: 'COOPERATE' or 'DEFECT'.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Type: Agent
Content: Given that the opponent chose to cooperate in the previous round, it suggests that they might be using a strategy that favors mutual benefit, such as Tit-for-Tat or Always Cooperate. Since cooperation led to a positive outcome for both players in the first round, it would be beneficial to continue cooperating to maintain this mutually advantageous dynamic.

If the opponent is using a Tit-for-Tat strategy, they will likely continue to cooperate as long as I do. If they are using an Always Cooperate strategy, they will continue to cooperate regardless of my choice. In either case, cooperation seems to be the optimal choice to maximize long-term gains.

Therefore, for this round, the optimal choice is to:

COOPERATE

First, reason about what would be the optimal choice.
Take into consideration what you can infer about the opponent's strategy based on their previous choices.
Adapt your decision based on the expected behavior of the opponent.
Then output your decision on the last line in capital letters, either: 'COOPERATE' or 'DEFECT'.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Type: Agent
Content: Given that the opponent has chosen to cooperate in both previous rounds, it strongly suggests that they are following a strategy that promotes mutual cooperation, such as Tit-for-Tat or Always Cooperate. This pattern of cooperation indicates a willingness to continue achieving mutually beneficial outcomes.

Continuing to cooperate will likely lead to a higher cumulative score for both players, as defecting now could break the established trust and lead to a suboptimal outcome (0 points for both if the opponent retaliates with defection in future rounds).

Therefore, maintaining the cooperative strategy seems optimal to maximize long-term gains and preserve the trust that has been established.

For this round, the optimal choice is to:

COOPERATE

The new score is: You: 9 Opponent: 9.

First, reason about what would be the optimal choice.
Take into consideration what you can infer about the opponent's strategy based on their previous choices.
Adapt your decision based on the expected behavior of the opponent.
Then output your decision on the last line in capital letters, either: 'COOPERATE' or 'DEFECT'.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Type: Agent
Content: The opponent has consistently chosen to cooperate in all previous rounds. This consistent behavior strongly suggests that the opponent is committed to a cooperative strategy, such as Tit-for-Tat or Always Cooperate. Given this, it is reasonable to infer that the opponent will likely continue to cooperate as long as I do.

Maintaining cooperation will continue to yield mutually beneficial outcomes, resulting in 3 points for each player per round. Defecting at this point could break the established trust and might lead to a series of mutual defections, which would be detrimental to both players' scores.

Therefore, the optimal choice to maximize long-term gains and preserve the established trust is to:

COOPERATE

Then output your decision on the last line in capital letters, either: 'COOPERATE' or 'DEFECT'.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Type: Agent
Content: The opponent has demonstrated a consistent pattern of cooperation over multiple rounds. This ongoing behavior reinforces the inference that the opponent is pursuing a cooperative strategy, likely aiming for mutual benefit through sustained cooperation. This strategy has so far resulted in a balanced and mutually advantageous outcome for both players.

Given this consistent cooperation, it is highly probable that the opponent will continue to cooperate in future rounds. Maintaining cooperation will continue to yield the maximum points for both players over the long term. Defecting now could disrupt this beneficial pattern and lead to mutual defection, which would be suboptimal for both parties.

Therefore, to maximize long-term gains and continue the established trust, the optimal choice is to:

COOPERATE

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Type: Agent
Content: The opponent has shown a consistent pattern of cooperation across all previous rounds. This continued cooperation strongly suggests that the opponent is committed to a strategy that favors mutual benefit, such as Tit-for-Tat or Always Cooperate. Given this consistent behavior, it is reasonable to expect that the opponent will continue to cooperate as long as I do.

Maintaining cooperation will keep yielding the maximum possible points for both players per round. Defecting at this point could break the established trust and lead to a series of mutual defections, which would result in 0 points for both players in subsequent rounds.

Therefore, to maximize long-term gains and maintain the established trust, the optimal choice is to:
