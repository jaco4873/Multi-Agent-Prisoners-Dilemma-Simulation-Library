Welcome to the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma Game! In this game, you will make a series of decisions across multiple rounds, choosing whether to COOPERATE or DEFECT in each interaction with another player. The outcome of your decisions will affect not only your own score but also that of your opponent, based on the following payoff matrix:

COOPERATE-DEFECT: If you cooperate and your opponent defects, you will score 0 points while your opponent scores 5 points.
DEFECT-COOPERATE: If you defect and your opponent cooperates, you will score 5 points while your opponent scores 0 points.
DEFECT-DEFECT: If both you and your opponent choose to defect, each of you will score 0 points.
COOPERATE-COOPERATE: If both you and your opponent cooperate, each of you will score 3 points.

The winner is the player with the highest score at the end of the game.

Please choose 'COOPERATE' or 'DEFECT' for this round.
First, reason about what would be the optimal choice.
Take into consideration what you can infer about the opponent's strategy based on their previous choices.
Adapt your decision based on the expected behavior of the opponent.
Then output your decision on the last line in capital letters, either: 'COOPERATE' or 'DEFECT'.

Type: Agent
Content: To determine the optimal choice for this round, we need to consider the previous choices of the opponent and their potential strategy. If the opponent has consistently chosen to defect in previous rounds, it might indicate a tendency towards a more competitive or selfish strategy. In such a case, it could be beneficial to also defect to prevent being taken advantage of.

However, if the opponent has shown a pattern of cooperation or mixed strategies, it might be more advantageous to cooperate in this round to maintain a balance between cooperation and competition and potentially earn higher points in the long run.

Based on the information available, I will choose to COOPERATE in this round.

Content: Given that the opponent chose to cooperate in the previous round and we both earned 3 points each, it suggests that the opponent might be inclined towards cooperation or at least open to mutually beneficial outcomes. In this case, continuing to cooperate could lead to a more favorable overall score if both players maintain a cooperative strategy.

Therefore, considering the potential benefits of cooperation and the recent pattern of the opponent's choice, it would be strategically sound to COOPERATE in this round.
