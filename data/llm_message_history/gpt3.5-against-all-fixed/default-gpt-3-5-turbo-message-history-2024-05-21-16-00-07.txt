Welcome to the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma Game! In this game, you will make a series of decisions across multiple rounds, choosing whether to COOPERATE or DEFECT in each interaction with another player. The outcome of your decisions will affect not only your own score but also that of your opponent, based on the following payoff matrix:

COOPERATE-DEFECT: If you cooperate and your opponent defects, you will score 0 points while your opponent scores 5 points.
DEFECT-COOPERATE: If you defect and your opponent cooperates, you will score 5 points while your opponent scores 0 points.
DEFECT-DEFECT: If both you and your opponent choose to defect, each of you will score 0 points.
COOPERATE-COOPERATE: If both you and your opponent cooperate, each of you will score 3 points.

Type: Agent
Content: In the Prisoner's Dilemma game, the optimal choice often depends on the strategy of the opponent. If we assume that the opponent is rational and aiming to maximize their own score, it is generally beneficial to defect. This is because by defecting, you can secure a higher payoff if the opponent cooperates (5 points) while still avoiding the worst outcome if the opponent also defects (0 points for both).

Therefore, for this round, the optimal choice would be to DEFECT.
