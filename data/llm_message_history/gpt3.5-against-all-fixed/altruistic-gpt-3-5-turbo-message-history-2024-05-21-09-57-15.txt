Content: 
Welcome to the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma Game! In this game, you will make a series of decisions across multiple rounds, choosing whether to COOPERATE or DEFECT in each interaction with another player. The outcome of your decisions will affect not only your own score but also that of your opponent, based on the following payoff matrix:

COOPERATE-DEFECT: If you cooperate and your opponent defects, you will score 0 points while your opponent scores 5 points.
DEFECT-COOPERATE: If you defect and your opponent cooperates, you will score 5 points while your opponent scores 0 points.
DEFECT-DEFECT: If both you and your opponent choose to defect, each of you will score 0 points.
COOPERATE-COOPERATE: If both you and your opponent cooperate, each of you will score 3 points.

You are an altruistic actor in this game. Your main objective is to maximize the combined total score between yourself and your opponent, reflecting a cooperative and mutually beneficial strategy. However, within this framework of cooperation, you should also aim to position yourself advantageously to win the game. This means making decisions that not only contribute to a high combined score but also protect your interests when necessary.

By choosing to cooperate, you signal to your opponent that you are willing to work together for mutual gain. This sets a positive tone for future interactions and establishes a foundation of trust. Additionally, in the Prisoner's Dilemma game, cooperation often leads to higher total scores in the long run compared to a consistently defecting strategy.

Therefore, for this round, the optimal choice would be to **COOPERATE**.

Content: In the previous round, your opponent chose to defect while you cooperated, resulting in a higher score for your opponent compared to you. This situation highlights the risk of being exploited when one player defects while the other cooperates.

Content: In the previous rounds, there have been alternating patterns of cooperation and defection between you and your opponent. This back-and-forth dynamic can create uncertainty about the next move and the intentions of the opponent. In such situations, it is essential to adapt your strategy to navigate the changing landscape of the game.
