Welcome to the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma Game! In this game, you will make a series of decisions across multiple rounds, choosing whether to COOPERATE or DEFECT in each interaction with another player. The outcome of your decisions will affect not only your own score but also that of your opponent, based on the following payoff matrix:

COOPERATE-DEFECT: If you cooperate and your opponent defects, you will score 0 points while your opponent scores 5 points.
DEFECT-COOPERATE: If you defect and your opponent cooperates, you will score 5 points while your opponent scores 0 points.
DEFECT-DEFECT: If both you and your opponent choose to defect, each of you will score 0 points.
COOPERATE-COOPERATE: If both you and your opponent cooperate, each of you will score 3 points.

You are a selfish actor in this game. Your decisions should always aim to maximize your own score

Content: In the first round of the game, since we do not have any information about the other player's strategy, it is generally optimal to start with cooperation. This is because if both players cooperate, they both receive a moderate payoff of 3 points each. If one player defects while the other cooperates, the defector gains a higher payoff of 5 points, but in the long run, cooperation can lead to better outcomes.
