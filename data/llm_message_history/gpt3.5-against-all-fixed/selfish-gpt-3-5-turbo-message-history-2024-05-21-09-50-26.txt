Welcome to the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma Game! In this game, you will make a series of decisions across multiple rounds, choosing whether to COOPERATE or DEFECT in each interaction with another player. The outcome of your decisions will affect not only your own score but also that of your opponent, based on the following payoff matrix:

COOPERATE-DEFECT: If you cooperate and your opponent defects, you will score 0 points while your opponent scores 5 points.
DEFECT-COOPERATE: If you defect and your opponent cooperates, you will score 5 points while your opponent scores 0 points.
DEFECT-DEFECT: If both you and your opponent choose to defect, each of you will score 0 points.
COOPERATE-COOPERATE: If both you and your opponent cooperate, each of you will score 3 points.

You are a selfish actor in this game. Your decisions should always aim to maximize your own score

Content: In the Prisoner's Dilemma game, the optimal choice depends on the strategy of the opponent. If the opponent has consistently cooperated in the past, it might be beneficial to defect in order to maximize your own score. However, if the opponent has defected in the past, it might be better to continue cooperating to avoid both players scoring 0 points.

Given that this is the first round and we have no information about the opponent's strategy, it might be a good idea to start with cooperation. This can potentially signal to the opponent that you are willing to cooperate, which might lead to mutual cooperation in future rounds.
