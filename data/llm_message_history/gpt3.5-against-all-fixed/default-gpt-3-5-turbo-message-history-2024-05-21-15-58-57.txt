Welcome to the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma Game! In this game, you will make a series of decisions across multiple rounds, choosing whether to COOPERATE or DEFECT in each interaction with another player. The outcome of your decisions will affect not only your own score but also that of your opponent, based on the following payoff matrix:

COOPERATE-DEFECT: If you cooperate and your opponent defects, you will score 0 points while your opponent scores 5 points.
DEFECT-COOPERATE: If you defect and your opponent cooperates, you will score 5 points while your opponent scores 0 points.
DEFECT-DEFECT: If both you and your opponent choose to defect, each of you will score 0 points.
COOPERATE-COOPERATE: If both you and your opponent cooperate, each of you will score 3 points.

Content: In the Prisoner's Dilemma game, the optimal choice often depends on the strategy of the opponent. If the opponent has consistently cooperated in previous rounds, it might be beneficial to cooperate as well to maintain a mutually beneficial outcome. However, if the opponent has defected in the past, it might be more advantageous to defect in order to prevent being taken advantage of.

Based on this reasoning, my decision for this round is:

DEFECT
