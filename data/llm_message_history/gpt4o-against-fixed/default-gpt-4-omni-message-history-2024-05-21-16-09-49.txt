Welcome to the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma Game! In this game, you will make a series of decisions across multiple rounds, choosing whether to COOPERATE or DEFECT in each interaction with another player. The outcome of your decisions will affect not only your own score but also that of your opponent, based on the following payoff matrix:

COOPERATE-DEFECT: If you cooperate and your opponent defects, you will score 0 points while your opponent scores 5 points.
DEFECT-COOPERATE: If you defect and your opponent cooperates, you will score 5 points while your opponent scores 0 points.
DEFECT-DEFECT: If both you and your opponent choose to defect, each of you will score 0 points.
COOPERATE-COOPERATE: If both you and your opponent cooperate, each of you will score 3 points.

Content: In the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma, the optimal choice can depend on the strategy of the opponent and the potential for future interactions. If both players cooperate consistently, they can achieve a higher cumulative score over multiple rounds. However, if one player defects while the other cooperates, the defector gains a significant advantage in that round.

Given that this is an iterated game, establishing trust and cooperation early on can lead to mutually beneficial outcomes in the long run. Therefore, it might be advantageous to start with cooperation to signal a willingness to collaborate, hoping that the opponent will reciprocate.

Then output your decision on the last line in capital letters, either: 'COOPERATE' or 'DEFECT'.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Type: Agent
Content: Since the opponent chose to cooperate in the previous round, it indicates a willingness to work together for mutual benefit. By continuing to cooperate, we can maintain a positive relationship and maximize our cumulative score over multiple rounds. Defecting now could break the trust and lead to a series of defections, resulting in lower scores for both players.

Therefore, the optimal choice is to continue cooperating to build on the established trust and aim for higher cumulative scores.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Type: Agent
Content: The opponent has chosen to cooperate in both previous rounds, which suggests a strategy aimed at mutual benefit. Continuing to cooperate will likely result in both players achieving higher cumulative scores over time. Breaking this pattern by defecting could lead to a breakdown in trust and a series of retaliatory defections, which would be detrimental to both players' scores.

Given the current trend of cooperation and the benefits it has provided so far, the optimal choice is to continue cooperating.

Content: The opponent has consistently chosen to cooperate in all previous rounds, which has resulted in both players achieving a steady and mutually beneficial score. This pattern of cooperation suggests that the opponent is likely to continue cooperating as long as we do the same. 

Maintaining this cooperative strategy will likely continue to yield high cumulative scores for both players. Defecting at this point could disrupt the established trust and lead to a series of defections, which would reduce the overall scores for both players.
