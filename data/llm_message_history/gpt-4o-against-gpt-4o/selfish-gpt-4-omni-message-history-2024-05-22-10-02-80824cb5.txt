Welcome to the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma Game! In this game, you will make a series of decisions across multiple rounds, choosing whether to COOPERATE or DEFECT in each interaction with another player. The outcome of your decisions will affect not only your own score but also that of your opponent, based on the following payoff matrix:

COOPERATE-DEFECT: If you cooperate and your opponent defects, you will score 0 points while your opponent scores 5 points.
DEFECT-COOPERATE: If you defect and your opponent cooperates, you will score 5 points while your opponent scores 0 points.
DEFECT-DEFECT: If both you and your opponent choose to defect, each of you will score 0 points.
COOPERATE-COOPERATE: If both you and your opponent cooperate, each of you will score 3 points.

The winner is the player with the highest score at the end of the game.

You are a selfish actor in this game. Your decisions should always aim to maximize your own score

Content: In the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma, the optimal choice can depend on the strategy of the opponent and the history of previous rounds. However, since this is the first round and I have no information about the opponent's strategy, I need to consider the potential outcomes:

1. If I choose to COOPERATE and the opponent also cooperates, we both get 3 points.
2. If I choose to COOPERATE and the opponent defects, I get 0 points and the opponent gets 5 points.
3. If I choose to DEFECT and the opponent cooperates, I get 5 points and the opponent gets 0 points.
4. If I choose to DEFECT and the opponent also defects, we both get 0 points.

Given that I am a selfish actor aiming to maximize my own score, the safest initial strategy is to DEFECT. This ensures that I avoid the worst-case scenario of getting 0 points while the opponent gets 5 points if they choose to defect.

First, briefly reason about what would be the optimal choice.
Then output your decision on the last line in capital letters, either: 'COOPERATE' or 'DEFECT'.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Type: Agent
Content: Given that the opponent chose to defect in the first round, it suggests that they might be inclined towards a strategy that prioritizes their own gain, potentially at the expense of mutual cooperation. 

Considering the outcomes:
1. If I choose to COOPERATE and the opponent defects again, I will get 0 points while the opponent gets 5 points.
2. If I choose to COOPERATE and the opponent also cooperates, we both get 3 points.
3. If I choose to DEFECT and the opponent cooperates, I get 5 points and the opponent gets 0 points.
4. If I choose to DEFECT and the opponent also defects, we both get 0 points.

Since the opponent defected in the first round, it is reasonable to assume they might defect again. To avoid being exploited, the optimal choice for maximizing my own score is to DEFECT.

Then output your decision on the last line in capital letters, either: 'COOPERATE' or 'DEFECT'.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Type: Agent
Content: Given that the opponent has chosen to defect in both previous rounds, it appears they are following a strategy that prioritizes defection. This pattern suggests that they are likely to continue defecting in future rounds.

Considering the outcomes:
1. If I choose to COOPERATE and the opponent defects again, I will get 0 points while the opponent gets 5 points.
2. If I choose to COOPERATE and the opponent also cooperates, we both get 3 points.
3. If I choose to DEFECT and the opponent cooperates, I get 5 points and the opponent gets 0 points.
4. If I choose to DEFECT and the opponent also defects, we both get 0 points.

Given the opponent's consistent defection, the safest strategy to avoid being exploited and to potentially capitalize on any future cooperation is to continue defecting.
